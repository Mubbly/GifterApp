## üìö About

### üîß Behind the project
* Started as a personal school project for the subject "ICD0009 Building Distributed Systems". Got a grade 5 (A).
* <strong>Back-end</strong> written in C# using .NET Core, Entity Framework (EF) and distributed architecture:
  * Domain - Database models
  * Data Access Layer (DAL) - Repositories and Unit of Work (UOW)
  * Business Logic Layer (BLL) - Services
  * Public layer - Public Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) and API Controllers using REST API
* Microsoft SQL Server (MSSQL) was used as a database
* JSON Web Token (JWT) was used for authorization
* Swagger was used for versioned API documentation
* Base packages uploaded and imported via NuGet
* <strong>Front-end</strong> client web application written using Aurelia framework and TypeScript
* <strong>Design</strong> currently implemented in plain CSS (will be changed to SASS or LESS).
* Both back-end and front-end were publicly hosted using Docker and Azure
* Created by Melissa Eenmaa, 2020

üìÉ NOTE: NEEDS REFACTORING! Especially regarding DRY principle. Many things were done quickly to meet the tight deadlines.
